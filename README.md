### An archive containing a whole heap of documentation and old tips and tricks used in Automobilista and rFactor. Original documents credited to their original creators.
## What is this?
This archive is a collection of the available documentation I can find throughout the internet that hasn't been corrupted by bitrot, death of websites and servers or been taken down due to the age of the original simulator and its engine which is going on just over 25 years old this year, with SportsCarGT being the first release on the ISImotor that we know as the motor that powered games such as Automobilista and rFactor 2.

Some things will change between Automobilista and rFactor, and this archive will more-so focus on Automobilista primarily, with rFactor a secondary focus, due to the lesser features of the simulator.

This archive's goal is to provide users and modders with the documentation and resources to create mods that could pass for stock content from Automobilista.
