# ISI HDV FILE DOCUMENTATION
A lot of the work here is credited to the Race Sim Central User "Bristow". Thanks be to him and all other contributors 
## Bristows Original Comments:
The rF engine.ini File

This thread is to record the contribution that the engine file makes to the definition of the cars in rFactor and to their behaviour.

In this thread is a posting at the top that contains an engine file from the original game - I have chosen the Sauber BMW released with version 1.150. Each line in the file is accompanied by the comments in the original. Lines are annotated with additional comments in bold about the purpose and role of the parameter, as the information becomes available. Due to the limits of my information, the data is incomplete and also probably wrong in places.

This thread is based on and updated from a similar thread I wrote for F1C. They may get a little out of synch from time to time. If there are contradictions, this thread will be more current.


Engine.ini files are text files and may be viewed and edited in any decent text editor or even Notepad.

There are be similar threads for the other physics files.

Contributions are invited to help fill in the gaps.
